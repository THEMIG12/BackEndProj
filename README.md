Create a github repo with a Node.js application that can do the following:
● Use ExpressJS as the framework.
● Create basic routing where each route/page represents an API.
○ Example: your page will have some links and each link will redirect the user to 
another page that will return data.
● Return a JSON response for each API.
● Create APIs that use GET, POST.
 
 The project should have 2 html pages :
1. The main page which will open an html contain a general info about a type of product 
2. The second page will contain a simple form to request this product 
 
 Your project should have “products.json” file which contains multi products and the api 
requests should deal with that file 
 
 Endpoints : 
1. Retrieve the main page -> Get 
2. Retrieve the form page -> Get 
3. Get All products -> Get 
4. RequestProduct -> post 
5. Add new product -> post
